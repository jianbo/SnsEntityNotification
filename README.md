# SnsEntityNotification

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/sns_entity_notification`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sns_entity_notification'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sns_entity_notification

## Usage

    To make ActiveRecord model send push notification
    class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_changed_notification composer: PushNotification::ModelDetailChangesComposer,
                                 recipients: -> (company) { company.employees.includes(:devices).map { |user| user.active_devices }.flatten } do
          set_message_details do |company|
            {
                event: PushNotification::MessageObject.event_types[:COMPANY_DETAIL_CHANGED],
                title: 'Company details has changed',
                message: "Company details changed @ #{company.updated_at}"
            }
          end
        end
    end

    This module is to be included into Device class, and expect device to have
    valid device_uuid (device token) endpoint_arn AWS SNS arn

    class Device
    include PushNotification::Client
    end
    device = Device.find(1)
    device.send_notification('message')

    data = {
    user_id: 1,
    os_family: 'Android',
    os_version: 'iOS6'
    ..
    }

    To createa a device
    Device.create_device!({
             device: 'Android',
             device_token: 'device_token',
    })
